# Connect Four Game

This is a **Connect Four** game built using **ReactJS**, inspired by the [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/connect-four-game-6G8QVH923s). The game allows two players to alternate turns on the same computer, dropping discs into a grid to see who can connect four of their discs in a row first.

## Features
- **Two-player mode**: Human vs. human gameplay, alternating turns on the same computer.
- **Dynamic game board**: Players drop discs into a 7x6 grid, and the game checks for the first to connect four discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- **Responsive design**: Adapted for various screen sizes, providing an optimal experience on desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack
- **ReactJS**: The core library used to build the interactive game.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved developer experience.
- **SCSS**: For styling and organizing styles in a modular way.

## How to Play
1. The game is played on a 7x6 grid.
2. Player 1 (red disc) goes first, followed by Player 2 (yellow disc).
3. Players alternate turns, clicking on a column to drop their disc into the lowest available space.
4. The first player to connect four discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
5. If the grid is full and no player has connected four, the game results in a draw.
